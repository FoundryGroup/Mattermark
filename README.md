> Python wrapper for the Mattermark REST API

[Mattermark](mattermark.com) is the best repository of company data on the internet and is used by marketers and data scientists everywhere to get relevant information on the companies they care about. They provide an awesome REST API that allows developers to integrate their service into custom solutions for teams and organizations. At Foundry group we use Mattermark to help us stay up-to-date with the companies and fund managers we care about. The goal of this package is to make it stupidly simple to interact with the Mattermark API using python.
